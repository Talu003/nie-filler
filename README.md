# NIE Filler

This is a userscript for NIE appointment request automation for EU citizens in Barcelona, Spain.

## Details ##

If you ever need to apply for NIE appointment in Barcelona, my condolences. Unless you are in a distant future from the moment when this script was created, things are not going to be too easy or convenient for you. Appointments become available at mostly random times and you are expected to re-enter all of your info on each attempt to register.

For better results try to apply with the help of this script every Monday from 7:55 AM to 8:15 AM. This is when batches of new appointments usually become available. They may randomly appear at other times but this time range is the one my HR department and I have had the most success with.

## Usage ##

* Install userscript in Chrome with Tampermonkey extension or in Firefox with Greasemonkey
* Enter your personal information in APPLICANTS
* Navigate to https://sede.administracionespublicas.gob.es/icpplustieb/citar
* Enter captcha when prompted

## Disclaimer ##

Although this script is *somewhat* configurable, it is by no measure a shining example of flexibility. It was written as a hotfix for a sad situation (HR department was doing this *manually* for years. In a company that has ~700 people in IT. Yeah...) and to speed up my own application process.

So any change in administrations website will most probably break it. If you're not comfortable fixing it on your own - feel free to contact me, I'll try to fix it.
